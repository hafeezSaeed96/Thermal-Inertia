# Thermal-Inertia
The report highlights the potential of white box forecasting tools to model thermal inertia of the urban buildings by using their metered heating data. The aim of this research is to examine how accurately an arima model can represent the thermal inertia of the buildings. This research employs hockey shaped energy signature regression model, to predict the energy data based upon temperature values. Furthermore, an extensive sensitivity analysis has been carried to check the impacts of various attributes such as time window, forecast length, time series length etc. on the model's performance. Finally, the paper also presents a detailed error analysis and validates our claim about potential of white box models in representation of building's thermal characteristics.
